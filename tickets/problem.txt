The rail network consists of 10 stations. The fare between each station is $2. There is a 10% discount when 3 or more passengers travel together. T
ickets can be purchased at any station using automated terminals.

Using pseudocode, or otherwise, write an algorithm for the automated terminals to:

• input the starting station number, the destination station number and the number of passengers
• calculate the total fare and output the amount to be paid
• calculate the change (if any)
• issue the rail ticket(s) and change [3]
